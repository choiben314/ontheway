Is it possible to get a refrigerator from New York to Boston in less than a day without shelling out exorbitant delivery fees? How can we make the shopping experience for disabled persons more convenient, cheap, and independent?

Description:
OnTheWay is an innovative P2P delivery system that harnesses the power of pre-existing routes to minimize the need for inconvenient, long-distance trips and therefore reduce environmental impact. Users are automatically matched to drivers who have the user item and pick-up spot along their route. Drivers are compensated by the user for the resulting minor detour.

Built Using: 
We used two apps, one for the user side and one for the driver side. Both apps were created using Java/Kotlin in Android Studio, with the driver app being optimized for General Motors vehicles with the General Motors API and the user app being optimized for mobile devices. Backend server api's were created using node.js and the Distance Matrix API on Google Cloud Platform.
